        " - The primary goal is to _free a kingdom from the rule of a dragon-tyrant_. This can be solved either by _confronting the tyrant_ or by _praying that the dragon will get the hell out of its den and fly where it came from_.\n",
        " - In order to _stand up to the dragon_, we must _go to his den_ and confront him.\n",
        " - The confrontation with the dragon itself can then be solved in various ways: we can _try to use our strength and kill the dragon_, or we can _rely on our eloquence and convince the dragon that being a tyrant is not OK_.\n",
        "- Hints:\n",
        " - Without loss of generality, it can be assumed that the root node is an OR one, and in each subsequent level of the tree the types of nodes alternate regularly (therefore it's not necessary to explicitly store this information in the graph).\n",
        " - To describe the (sub)problems (i.e. graph nodes) and store information about their being solved or not, you can use the corresponding global annotation dictionaries `description` and` solved`. Alternatively, these can be passed as arguments to your functions.\n",
