    "- Ontologies are machine-readable formalizations of general or domain knowledge. They typically address the following:\n",
    "  - representation, formal naming and definition of general categories (also called concepts or classes) and sets of specific entities that fall under these categories (these entities are usually called individuals, instances or objects);\n",
    "  - properties of the categories and individual entities;\n",
    "  - relationships between categories and individuals (super- and sub-classes, instances of classes);\n",
    "  - metadata and annotations that do not affect the logical interpretation (i.e., formal meaning) of the elements of the ontology, but can be useful for people and applications working with the ontology.\n",
    "- The formal basis of ontologies is usually propositional and/or first-order predicate logic (FOL), or rather its decidable subsets and/or extensions (e.g., fuzzy or probabilistic).\n",
    "- No tractable formalism uses the full range of possibilities of FOL (even the less expressive variants of languages ​​for the representation of ontologies are relatively demanding in terms of reasoning complexity).\n",
    "- In these labs we will deal with ontologies represented in the [OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) language, which is the \"flagship\" of the [W3C standard](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) for [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web), based on [descriptive logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_logic) (an extensively researched and relatively widely used formalism, especially in the [knowledge representation and reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) community)."
