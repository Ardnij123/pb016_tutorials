    "- One of the foundational algorithms for performing search in state spaces, which are typically represented as graphs (either explicit, or implicit, as in most actual practical problems).\n",
    "- The algorithm is based on traversing the graph from one root vertex.\n",
    "- It prioritises going as far as possible from the root at first.\n",
    "- Whenever there is nowhere else to go, the algorithm [backtracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) to the nearest vertex from which the search can continue.\n",

    "- We iterate through a list of the current vertex neighbours and continue searching from every vertex that has not been visited before.\n",

    "Notes:\n",
    "- For creating and manipulating the graph, we use the popular [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/index.html) library.\n",
    "- The depth-first principle doesn't necessarily mean there is always only one possible sequence in which a graph may be searched by DFS (as shown in the sample code below where the search sequence depends on the order in which the edges were added to the graph as it was being created)."
